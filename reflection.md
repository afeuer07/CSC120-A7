- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance makes it much quicker to write classes that have a lot in common by allowing them to share methods and attributes. This would have been quite redundant if all of the types of buildings didn't extend Building and inherit its basic set up. This was a little painful because I did it all in one sitting so I'd recommend not doing that, but overall it was a relatively straightforward assignment. And using hashtable was fun!
